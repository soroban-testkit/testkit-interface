# Soroban Testkit Interface

A visual companion to [Soroban Testkit](https://github.com/soroban-testkit/testkit-blockchain). It documents the library's focused testing modules and provides a command builder for the supported CLI workflows.

The interface does not execute contracts in the browser. Generated commands run locally through `soroban-testkit`, keeping contract tests deterministic and offline as required by the core project.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Validation

```sh
npm run build
npm test
```

## Project boundary

- Rust testing library and CLI: `testkit-blockchain`
- Documentation and CLI workbench: this repository
